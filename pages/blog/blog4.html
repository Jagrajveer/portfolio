      <h1>Website Security</h1>

      <p>
        Website security is essential because nowadays, so much sensitive
        information travels through the internet. Therefore, before sending, the
        data should be encrypted so that a third person cannot sniff the data
        travelling from one source to another. So, to protect this data,
        encryption protocols are used. Many protocols are used to encrypt the
        data but, the most used are SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) / TLS ( Transport
        Layer Security).
      </p>
      <h2>What are SSL and TLS?</h2>
      <p>
        Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is an encryption protocol and, it was first
        published in 1995 by Taher Elgamal. There were 3 versions of SSL: SSL
        1.0, SSL 2.0, and SSL 3.0. SSL protocol was fully deprecated in 2015
        because it was no longer secure. TLS(Transport Layer Security), a
        Decedent of SSL, has taken its place. The first version of TLS came out
        in January 1999 and, then TLS 1.0, TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3 were defined.
        TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 are still in use but, other versions were deprecated.
      </p>
      <h2>The authenticity of a Website</h2>
      <p>
        SSL certificate, also known as TLS certificate, authenticates a
        website's identity and enables an encrypted connection with an entity
        with a public key. It also ensures that the content is sent from a web
        server is authenticated. SSL certificate is issued by a trusted entity
        called the SSL certificate authority. Certificates are of different
        types: Email certificates to secure emails, EMV certificates for secure
        card payments and many more.
      </p>
      <h2>HTTP and HTTPS Which One to Choose</h2>

          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          HTTP was invented by Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN in 1991. If
          a URL of a website starts with HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), it
          is unsecured and, if it begins with HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol
          Secured), it is secured. HTTP transfers data without encryption and,
          anyone who can intercept the communication will access all the
          information. But with HTTPS, all the data is encrypted before
          transferring. Therefore, if sharing confidential information over the
          internet, make sure that the site is an HTTPS site.
        </p>

      <h2>Encryption</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Encryption takes plain text, runs it through an algorithm, and
          converts it into an unreadable format called ciphertext. This helps
          protect confidential information that is transmitted through the
          internet or stored on a computer system. Unencrypted data can be used
          against you, or someone could take advantage of your bank credentials
          and credit card information.
