      <h2>Traditional methods of password management</h2>
      <p>
        Passwords were managed using writing them on paper and using only
        alphabets or numbers. Reusing the same passwords across different
        websites. These methods make hacking a password very easy because it
        takes very little time to crack them. Before people share passwords with
        an untrusted person.
      </p>
      <h2>Modern methods of password management</h2>
      <p>
        People use a mixture of alphabets, numbers, and symbols to create strong
        passwords. Reset passwords regularly and using two-factor
        authentication(2FA). 2FA is a method that helps to secure an account. It
        uses another pin or uses a mobile phone that receives a token every time
        an account is accessed. Store passwords in someplace safe and only share
        passwords with trusted people. Websites also provide a secure valet that
        saves your password in a secure place and stores them after encrypting
        them.
      </p>
      <h2>Threats from hacking</h2>
      <p>
        People with your passwords can access sensitive information. People can
        hack your bank account password or credit card password that can cause
        you a lot of trouble. If your social account gets hacked, then people
        with its password can use it to do bad things resulting in you get in
        trouble. The big company also suffers lots of damage if someone hacks it
        there network stealing sensitive information about the company or people
        using their services.
